Thousands of Congress workers from the erstwhile Warangal district arrived in Bhupalpally to extend their support to the new member. 

            Speaking at a public meeting,  Revanth said, “During the Statehood movement, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the TRS agenda was similar to the Naxal agenda. What kind of Naxal agenda gives power to the State to kill innocent youth in police encounters,” he asked. 
            
            Revanth asked if the Chief Minister would end encounters or continue spilling the blood of poor people in Telangana. 
            
            “At least 1,200 students had sacrificed their lives for the  Telangana State. Did the Chief Minister do anything for their families,” he asked. He said further said that KCR failed to implement his promise of building an underground coal mine. “The Chief Minister, however, encouraged open cast mining. But due to this, many villagers are losing their lands and livelihood in Bhupalpally district,” said Revanth.
